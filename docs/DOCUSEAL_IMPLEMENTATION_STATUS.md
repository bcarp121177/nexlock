## Configuration Checklist

Before using the signature feature:

- [ ] Install gems: `bundle install`
- [ ] Create DocuSeal account
- [ ] Create template in DocuSeal dashboard (see DOCUSEAL_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Configure webhook in DocuSeal dashboard
- [ ] Add credentials to Rails:
  ```bash
  EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit --environment development
  ```
  Add:
  ```yaml
  docuseal:
    api_key: ds_your_key
    api_url: https://api.docuseal.com
    webhook_secret: whsec_your_secret
    trade_agreement_template_id: your_template_id
  ```
- [ ] Restart Rails server
- [ ] Verify configuration in logs:
  ```
  ‚úì DocuSeal configured successfully
  ```
- [ ] Set up ngrok for local webhook testing (optional)

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:

1. ‚úÖ Service layer can create DocuSeal submissions
2. ‚úÖ Webhooks can process signature completions
3. ‚úÖ Signed PDFs are stored in Active Storage
4. ‚úÖ State machine transitions work correctly
5. ‚ùå UI allows users to initiate and complete signatures
6. ‚ùå Email notifications are sent at key milestones
7. ‚ùå Tests cover critical paths
8. ‚ùå Documentation is complete and accurate

**Current Status:** 4/8 criteria met (50%)

---

## Notes

- All database schema changes were already in place
- State machine was already configured
- No migrations needed
- Active Storage was already configured
- The implementation is additive - it doesn't break existing functionality
- The old "send_to_buyer" ‚Üí "agree" flow remains functional
- Signature workflow is optional until UI is built

# Dispute Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Users (buyers and sellers) can now open disputes at any point during the trade workflow. This allows you to learn about real-world issues and questions that arise during the escrow process during the MVP phase.

## User-Facing Features

### 1. Open Dispute Button (Trade Show Page)
**Location:** Right sidebar on `/trades/:id`

**Visibility:**
- Shows "Need Help?" card for buyers and sellers on non-completed trades
- Hides if dispute already exists (shows "Dispute Active" card instead)
- Not shown for completed trades (accepted, released, refunded, resolved_*)

**Functionality:**
- Click "Open Dispute" button
- Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to open a dispute?"
- Creates dispute record and transitions trade to `disputed` state
- Redirects back to trade with success message
- Admin is notified (future: add email notification)

### 2. Dispute Link on Trades Index
**Location:** Actions column on `/trades`

**Shows:**
- **"Dispute" link** (red) if dispute exists → Opens admin dispute view in new tab
- **"Can dispute" indicator** if trade is in disputable state but no dispute exists yet
- **Only "View" link** for completed/non-disputable trades

## Admin Features

### 3. Dispute Management Dashboard
**Location:** `/admin/disputes`

**Features:**
- List all disputes with status filtering

- Rejection category (if applicable)
- Evidence submitted by parties
- Activity audit log

**Resolution Actions:**
Three buttons available for open disputes:

1. **Refund Buyer (100%)**

   - Amount: Calculated by `trade.calculate_refund_amount`
   - Transitions to `resolved_refund` state

2. **Release to Seller (100%)**
   - Full payout to seller
   - Amount: Calculated by `TradeService.calculate_payout_amount`
   - Transitions to `resolved_release` state

3. **Split Decision**
   - Default: 50/50 split
   - Customizable seller percentage (0-100%)
   - Stores resolution data in dispute record
   - Transitions to `resolved_split` state
   - ⚠️ **Note:** Split payout logic is logged but not implemented yet

## Usage Flow

### User Opens Dispute
1. User navigates to trade: `/trades/:id`
2. Clicks "Open Dispute" in sidebar
3. Confirms action in dialog
4. System creates dispute record:
   ```ruby
   Dispute.create!(
     account: trade.account,
     trade: trade,
     opened_by: current_user,
     status: 'open',
     reason: "User requested dispute from trade #{trade.id}"
   )
   ```
5. Trade transitions to `disputed` state (if allowed)
6. Audit log created
7. User sees "Dispute Active" card with link to view

### Admin Resolves Dispute
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/disputes`
2. Clicks dispute to view details
3. Reviews trade info, evidence, audit log
4. Chooses resolution:
   - **Refund Buyer** → Calls `trade.resolve_with_refund!` → Triggers Stripe refund
   - **Release to Seller** → Calls `trade.resolve_with_release!` → Triggers Stripe payout
   - **Split** → Calls `trade.resolve_with_split!` → Logs split (needs implementation)
5. Trade transitions to resolved state
6. Emails sent to parties (via existing notification system)

## MVP Learning Opportunities

By allowing disputes at any point, you can learn:

1. **When disputes occur most frequently**
   - During shipping?
   - During inspection?
   - Before funding?

2. **What issues come up**
   - Common rejection categories
   - Shipping problems
   - Communication breakdowns
   - Trust issues

3. **What evidence users provide**
   - Photos/videos
   - Written descriptions
   - External documentation

4. **What questions users ask**
   - Captured in dispute reason/notes
   - Can inform UI/UX improvements
   - Identify missing features

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- [ ] Email notifications when dispute is opened
- [ ] Email notifications when dispute is resolved
- [ ] Add notes/comments to disputes
- [ ] Allow users to submit additional evidence after opening dispute

### Medium-term
- [ ] Implement actual split payout logic (partial refund + partial payout)
- [ ] Add dispute status updates (open → under_review → resolved)
- [ ] Create dispute templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Add dispute analytics dashboard

### Long-term
- [ ] Automated dispute resolution for simple cases
- [ ] Dispute mediation workflow (back-and-forth communication)
- [ ] Third-party arbitration integration
- [ ] Dispute prevention (warnings before actions)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open dispute from funded trade
- [ ] Open dispute from shipped trade
- [ ] Open dispute from inspection state
- [ ] Verify cannot open dispute from completed trade
- [ ] Verify cannot open second dispute on same trade
- [ ] Admin can view all disputes
- [ ] Admin can refund buyer
- [ ] Admin can release to seller
- [ ] Admin can split (check logs)
- [ ] Verify dispute link shows on trades index
- [ ] Verify "Dispute Active" card shows on trade show page
- [ ] Verify audit logs are created

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**
- Only buyer or seller can open dispute
- Only one dispute per trade
- Cannot dispute completed trades
- Admin authentication required for resolution
- Audit trail logged

⚠️ **Future:**
- Rate limiting (prevent spam disputes)
- Abuse detection (repeated frivolous disputes)
- Evidence validation (prevent fake evidence)

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for MVP Testing
